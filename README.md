# IFAQ (infrequently asked questions)

1. What the fuck is this?...


   A pet project to make it easier to track equipment missing from the game warframe

2. How does it work?


   Yes

3. How do I use it?...


   You can download index.html and the /static/ directory to a local folder OR you can [goto](http://devdave.github.id/wfmastery) there.


4. What is the rest of this stuff?...


    ...An excuse to play with various python technologies.  I retired a few years ago which has dramatically changed
    my attitude of what is/is not acceptable code.  Granted most of the stuff I made public on github is kinda scary
    but to my knowledge it is not laced with as many snide comments, passive aggressive title attributes, and has 99% less
    explitives.


    ...Sooooooo what I am saying is that their is some serious fuckery going on inside this project.  Including many intentional grahmah and spalling mistakes.  On that
    last part I have a list of what pendantic assholes get pissed of at online and I am using it like a checklist.  Case in point.
